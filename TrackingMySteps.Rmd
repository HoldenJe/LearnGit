Keeping track of my steps:
1. I made a repo in Github
2. Created a readme and made a commit
3. Create new project in RStudio
4. From a Git repository
5. Copied credentials.
6. Created a new branch called dev_jer for local work
7. Created this documented, made a commit.
8. Added a function, made a commit

New contributors
1. A different user can now fork (top right of github)
2. While there, create a new branch (dev_yourname)
2. Return to RStudio
3. Create New Project from GitHub repository
4. add https://github.com/YOURNAME/LearnGit as the url that you want to use to start the project
5. Check the directory where you want to save it - then do it!
6. When the project opens all the files should be cloned to your local project file
7. Make sure you are on the dev_yourname branch
8. Do some stuff, make some commits
9. Then do a push to your github
10. Go to github and do a pull request
11. I'll get an email telling me that you want to add something

Merging contributions
1. On Github - merge to main
2. Do a local pull request to update local main
3. Switch to dev_* branch and "update from main"

Some thoughts
1. I think contributors should fork from a development branch
2. Then, "production" files can be pushed to main
3. This keeps the main branch as uncluttered as possible
4. Maybe...
