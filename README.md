# LearnGit
Team GFS is learning to use Git in this repo

Our first exercise is to re-create a short section of a past LOMU Annual Report since it's already a public document. We'll use Section 8.4 in the 2017 Annual Report (http://www.glfc.org/loc_mgmt_unit/) as it's mostly text based and we can ignore adding the image at this point so we can just work in Github to practice commits and pull requests. I'll eventually add the image to a directory in this project as we wrap up the text.

For the assignment you must copy a portion of the text (not more than a paragraph), intentionally alter the text that you copied to include a typo and then submit a pull request. When everyone has added some text we'll go back and fix the typos using the same pull request process.

Good luck.
