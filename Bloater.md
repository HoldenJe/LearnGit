Potential long-term benefits of restoring Bloater include restoring historical food feb structures and function in Lake Ontario, increasing the diversity of the prey fish community, increasing resistance of the foood web to new species invasions, increasing wild production of salmon and trout

In 2017, there were 169,000 fall yearling (age-1)... Bloater were stocked by MNRF at two stocking locations. 12,000 were stocked near Main Duck Island (in ‘the trench’) to support ongoing research activities along with an additional 119 older fish (see Section 9.1). 

Rapid compression as stocked individuals moved to the Lake bottom was proposed as a potential cause of mortality in an acoustic tagging study (see Section 9.2)
