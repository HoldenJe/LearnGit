## WARNING
**I'm not an expert.**  

Today is a quick overview of some of the use cases.

I've reached out to MSU/QFC to deliver a full training course on how to use Git and Github.
Expectation is that an online course will be available by June or July. *Stay tuned.*


## Git vs Github

Git | Github
----|--------
Version control | Online web service
"unlimited undo" | Share and collaborate code and text
Works locally | Online repositories (including private)
Track changes | Track changes but in a nice web format


Most work flows utilize features of both.

## Common Git Work flow
```
git init
```
* This opens a hidden database to track your files.
<br>
<br>

``` 
git add my_awesome_file.txt
```
* Tells Git to track changes to `my_awesome_file.txt`
<br>
<br>

```
git commit -m "Tell Git what you did"
```
* Takes a snapshot of the files and records an descriptive message
