## Git vs Github

Git | Github
----|--------
Version control | Online web service
"unlimited undo" | Share and collaborate code and text
Works locally | Online repositories (including private)
Track changes | Track changes but in a nice web format


Most work flows utilize features of both.

## Common Git Work flow
```
git init
```
* This opens a hidden database to track your files.
<br>
<br>

``` 
git add my_awesome_file.txt
```
* Tells Git to track changes to `my_awesome_file.txt`
<br>
<br>

```
git commit -m "Tell Git what you did"
```
* Takes a snapshot of the files and records an descriptive message

## Github
```
git pull
```
* looks for changes in a remote repository

```
git push
```
* asks to incorporate your local changes to a remote repository


## RStudio provides GUI support
* RStudio provides a graphical user interface to help with the easy commands
* Also provides a terminal when you feel like you need to get into/out of trouble
<br>
<br>
*See also: Git GUI, Github Desktop, numerous others

## Two Examples
1. Start using Git in an existing directory
2. Create a project linked to Github
